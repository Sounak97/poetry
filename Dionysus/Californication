The shades of life and light of death,
In turquoise rhyme, the poets wait,
Patient feline, with taut held breath.
Deep eyes brim hope, for a land of gold.
Gardens far and cold birds shine,
In springtime nectar, post-autumn wine,
To grander themes do thoughts incline,
For distant mountaintops repine,
Deep in languid heart, doom’d ideals hold.

Predators encircle in concurrency,
Vultures hound, don’t you see?
They close in fast, onto you and me!
Eagerness amplified in their denial of self.
